The [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) pandemic has taken lives across the globe. What follows is grave economic consequences, many will be cut off from their livelihood for some uncertain period of time. While the governments may try to help these people directly, the effectiveness of each government, the level of national savings and the solidarity of the communities will cast further uncertainty to lives of tens of millions of people.

Bitcoin was born during the period of 2008 financial crisis, imbuded with cynicism of distruting the existing financial system. A decade later, many alternative systems were created, and an entire industry now sometimes known as the crypto industry has been built around them. During these years, many deceptions, false hopes and bubbles have ironically occured to the crypto industry also. A credibility crisis is real in the crypto industry. But the globalness, openness and the continued innovations are the strength of the cryptos. As a industry, it is our chance to show the world that crypto can be used to solve the crisis.
